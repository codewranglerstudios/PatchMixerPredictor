# PatchMixerPredictor
An Experimental Stock Trading Strategy Leveraging the PatchMixer CNN Based Model
Overview
PatchMixerPredictor combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create a sophisticated stock trading strategy. This innovative approach forecasts stock prices and makes real-time trading decisions designed to maximize profits while managing risks effectively.

Key Components:
CNN-Based Forecasting Model

Forecasts future stock prices over the next 128 time steps using historical data.
Identifies actionable trends while minimizing market noise.
Reinforcement Learning Agent

Executes trades (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on CNN predictions and market dynamics.
Adapts dynamically to changing market conditions, optimizing profitability over time.
How It Works
1. CNN-Based Forecasting
Purpose: Predicts stock Close prices for 128 future time steps.
How It Works:
Analyzes historical price data over 512 time steps to detect patterns and trends.
Outputs multi-step forecasts to capture short- and medium-term market movements.
Why It Adds Value:
Focuses on actionable trends by reducing noise in the data.
Provides a reliable foundation for the RL agent's decision-making.
2. Reinforcement Learning Agent
Purpose: Executes trades using CNN predictions and additional metrics.
How It Works:
State Variables: CNN predictions, account balance, transaction costs, and risk metrics.
Actions:
Buy: Acquire shares when prices are expected to rise.
Sell: Lock in profits or minimize losses when prices are forecasted to drop.
Hold: Maintain the position when the market outlook is uncertain.
Reward: Calculated based on portfolio returns or risk-adjusted metrics like the Sharpe ratio.
Why It Adds Value:
Adapts dynamically to new market conditions.
Balances risk and reward efficiently, avoiding overtrading or high-risk decisions.
Explores and optimizes diverse trading strategies.
3. Profit Generation
The strategyâ€™s profitability is driven by:

Predictive Power:

The CNN leverages historical data to predict trends, reducing subjective or random decisions.
Dynamic Adaptation:

The RL agent adjusts to new patterns and conditions for robust market performance.
Risk Management:

Incorporates risk metrics and transaction costs for efficient, low-risk trades.
Multi-Step Predictions:

Forecasting over 128 time steps captures opportunities across short and medium-term horizons.
Data-Driven Decisions:

Combines quantitative forecasting with policy optimization to exploit market inefficiencies.
Why This Strategy Produces Profit
Exploiting Market Inefficiencies:

Identifies and acts on patterns in semi-efficient markets.
Probabilistic Decision-Making:

The RL agent makes rational, probability-based decisions, avoiding emotional biases.
Continuous Improvement:

Regular retraining ensures effectiveness in evolving market conditions.
Diversified Revenue Streams:

The ability to trade in both upward and downward markets ensures consistent profitability.
Assumptions for Success
High-Quality Data:

Accurate, up-to-date stock data from reliable sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
Stable Model Performance:

The CNN and RL agent must generalize effectively to unseen data.
Efficient Trade Execution:

Minimized latency and transaction costs are critical.
